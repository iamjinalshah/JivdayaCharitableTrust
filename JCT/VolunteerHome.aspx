Volunteering is easy! The first thing you need to do is get online and do a search for a shelter near you and contact them via phone or email. Search sites such as Petfinder&#8217;s Animal Shelters & Rescues, the ASPCA&#8217;s Find a Shelter, or at AdoptaPet.com. 
    <br />
    <br />
    Then, because shelters can always use help, check in to see what volunteer positions are available or offer the skills that you&#8217;ve got. In any case, there are a number of ways a wonderful, caring, and passionate person such as yourself can volunteer at a local animal shelter.<br />
    <br />
    <br />
    1. Walk, play with the dogs All dogs are different. Some are high energy, always 
    wanting to be on the move, other dogs are more sedentary, while others might 
    need a little encouragement to get out and stretch their legs. Since the number 
    of staff at most animal shelters are small, set aside time during the week to 
    offer dog walking, running, or playing services, so valuable time is not taken 
    away from the staff.<br />
    <br />
    2. Read to cats and dogs This can be a fantastic experience for adults and 
    children. Reading out loud can be soothing and comforting to shelter animals 
    while also improving children&#8217;s reading skills.<br />
    <br />
    3. Clean the kennels and cages Dogs, cats, birds, lizards, guinea pigs, rabbits 
    &#8230; they all poop, pee, and track dirt in. Volunteer to clean out animal living 
    quarters using donated all-natural cleaning products that are pet safe.<br />
    <br />
    4. Open up your home on weekends Although maintained and cleaned, those kennels 
    can get an animal a little down. Think about opening up your home periodically 
    to shelter animals for a weekend dog or cat sleepover or simply take a day trip 
    to the park, then lunch at your place afterward.<br />
    <br />
    5. Use social media Got social media skills? Volunteer to be the shelter&#8217;s 
    online community manager to create compelling content, post adoption or found 
    photos, recruit new volunteers, and communicate with the public. Social media 
    platforms are also a great place to post educational information related to pet 
    guardianship and general animal welfare.
    <br />
    <br />
    6. Write the newsletter Use your writing skills to communicate with shelter 
    supporters, members, and the public about recent adoptions, donations needed, 
    upcoming events, and pet related articles. Not a writer? Newsletters need 
    volunteers to help with layout, design, and publishing!<br />
    <br />
    7. Take animal profile photos Shelters usually have &#8220;adoptable pet&#8221; profiles on 
    their website. If you are a local animal loving photographer, consider donating 
    a couple hours a week of photo and photo software skills and take fabulous, 
    flattering pet pics.&nbsp;
    <br />
    <br />
    8. Work at special adoption events Be an &#8220;animal chaperone&#8221; at special events 
    put on by the animal shelter that invites the public in to meet and greet 
    adoptable pets. You can also work off-site pet adoption events that are held by 
    other animal welfare organizations, news stations, or at community functions.</div>
