                &nbsp;<br />Jivdaya Charitable Trust Trust is established to help stray animals 
                and birds who are injured and sick. One of our founder members, Mrs. Gira Shah 
                while working with Animal Help Foundation observed that removing a stray animal 
                from its original location causes it a lot of stress which delays its recovery. 
                Therefore Jivdaya Charitable Trust decided to start Mobile Animal Clinics.We have three Ambulance Vans working as Mobile clinics with qualified and experienced Veterinarians along with a supporting staff.<br />
                <br />
                Our Mobile clinics are fully equipped with all types of medical and surgical 
                equipments. Our control room gets calls from the public about injured or sick 
                animals. The control room records the address, phone number, and type of animal 
                and its injury. These details are passed to the Mobile Van providing service to 
                animals in the field. Doctors attend to the animal on their route. In case of an 
                emergency, the control room directs the Van to rush immediately to that place. 
                Each clinic is operational in predetermined areas in the Western part of the 
                city. We intend to cover more areas after the addition of more mobile vans and 
                medical team.
                <br />
                <br />
                There are animal lovers who desire to give quick treatment to animals and birds 
                suffering from pain or battling for life due to accidents. Such animal lovers 
                bring the animals to our control room. We are operational during the working 
                hours.Facilities of a well equipped Operation Theatre and an X-ray unit are 
                available to attend to surgical cases as well. Hospital Facilities are available 
                to provide treatment to animals and birds who are admitted to our centre. A 
                shelter house is also maintained for selected birds.
                <br />
                <br />
                The awareness campaign is essential to enhance the plight of the speechless 
                animals/ birds. This will reduce the cases of cruelty and road accidents. In 
                addition, citizens will be motivated to provide food to animals/ birds, be kind 
                to them and help them receive medical aid when necessary.

                <span class="style12">Save birds Campaign 2009 and 2010 Uttarayan is a major 
                event where large numbers of birds are injured by glass coated threads. 
                Extensive arrangements are required during these days to save the birds. In 
                January 2009, Uttarayan, Jivdaya Charitable Trust actively participated in &#8220;Save 
                Birds campaign 2009&#8221; and treated 594 injured birds.In Uttrayan 2010 &#8220;Save Bird 
                Campaign&#8221;&#8221; was organized on a large scale. A team of 40 veterinarians and many 
                volunteers attended to more than 2000 birds. Seventy Five percent birds 
                recovered and most of them were released and rehabilitated in their habitats. 
                The entire program was carried out in collaboration with the Gujarat Forest 
                Department.
                <br />
                <br />
                In July 2010 we organized a &#8220;Free Eye Check-up Camp&#8220; for animals in 
                collaboration with College of Veterinary Science Anand. 38 animals including 
                dogs, cats, rabbits and cows were examined for eye ailments and given treatment 
                if required. In order to achieve our goals regarding &#8220;Welfare of Animals and 
                Birds&#8221; we strive to achieve the following.
